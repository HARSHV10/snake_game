classic snake game "eat more to grow more"

Snake is a video game genre where the player maneuvers a growing line that becomes a primary obstacle to itself.
The concept originated in the 1976 two-player arcade game Blockade from Gremlin Industries,
and the ease of implementation has led to hundreds of versions for many platforms.
The player controls a dot, square, or object on a bordered plane. As it moves forward, it leaves a trail behind, resembling a moving snake.
In some games, the end of the trail is in a fixed position, so the snake continually gets longer as it moves. In another common scheme, 
the snake has a specific length, so there is a moving tail a fixed number of units away from the head.
The player loses when the snake runs into the screen border, other obstacle, or itself
